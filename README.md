# ModernCPP
Modern C++ features by example code.

## About
Introducing C++17 features by example and providing a space for quickly looking those features up.

The code examples have been taken from the excellent book [1] and extended such that they produce console executables which typically simply write some results on standard out. In addition the example code has been annotated with explanations taken and summarised from the book.

This may also serve as a quick and informal test whether the compiler is properly setup and C++17 capable.

## Compilation
The simple compilation steps are described in the [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) file.
